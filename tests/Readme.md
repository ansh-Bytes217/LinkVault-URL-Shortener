Testing Url Shortener Service

Prerequisites

If testing locally, ensure that MongoDB and Redis are running either in Docker or locally
Ensure the .env file contains isLocal=True (considering tests have localhost being used)
Start the app server by running python fapp.py
Perform a health check at the /health route to ensure that both databases do not display any error messages
This project uses the pytest framework along with the pytest-asyncio plugin. The code -

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def test_app():
    app.dependency_overrides = {}
    # Using async with for proper handling of the AsyncClient instance
    async with AsyncClient(app=app, base_url="http://localhost:5000") as ac:
        yield ac  # Yield the client to the test
This sets up an instance of your app. It overrides existing connections or external APIs to clear test environments and creates a test Async client to simulate HTTP requests to the FastAPI app. The test client ac is then yielded to be used in test functions.

Important - Setting scope="module" in the @pytest.fixture ensures that the event loop remains active for all test cases within the module. Without this, the event loop may end prematurely, causing errors. Using scope="session" resulted in errors, but setting it to scope="module" resolved the issue by keeping the event loop active until all tests in the module are completed.
Note - The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"

Then we create another fixture to setup DB for the app state -

@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
async def setup_test_db():
    # Setup MongoDB and Redis for testing
    app.state.client = AsyncIOMotorClient("mongodb://localhost:27017")
    app.state.db = app.state.client.test_db
    app.state.collection = app.state.db.test_collection
    app.state.redis = redis.from_url("redis://localhost:6379")
    yield
We define test cases via @pytest.mark.anyio.

We initialize the clients for each test (note that the fixtures themselves do not use await) and their implementation will consist of async-await methods. 
Note - The test_app and setup_test_db are the pytest fixtures to tear down resources for testing proving reusable code blocks and doing dependency injection in the below code block.

@pytest.mark.anyio
async def test_mong_redis(test_app, setup_test_db):
    mongodb_ping = await app.state.db.client.admin.command("ping")
    redis_ping = await app.state.redis.ping()
    assert mongodb_ping == {'ok': 1.0}
    assert redis_ping == True
The reason we changed @pytest.mark.asyncio to @pytest.mark.anyio was that in former the httpx app client as returning async_generator() and not the actual client.

Refer to other solution using @pytest_asyncio.fixture here - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72996818/attributeerror-in-pytest-with-asyncio-after-include-code-in-fixtures

Also, with anyio, you can use other concurrency packages like asyncio and trio for tests and APIs.

The tests are added automatically based on assert in the code -

assert response.status_code == 200
assert response.json() == {"message":"Home page"}
Tests Hierarchy Issues

Current Hierarchy
project/
│

├── fapp.py

└── tests/

    └── test_fapp.py
    
To resolve import path issues when the tests folder needs to import fapp.py from the parent directory, add the following code:

import sys
sys.path.append('../')
This modifies the python import path so python will look into that directory (parent in this case) when searching modules (fapp imported as module). This was done as the module or script is not in same folder but higher/lower in hierarchy.

Running Tests - Inside your terminal inside the tests folder, run command pytest
